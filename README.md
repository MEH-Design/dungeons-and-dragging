# Dungeons and Dragging

This project is currently still in early development. There is no playable content yet.
If you *still* want to test it out (and I admire you for your determination if you do) you can try it anytime at https://meh-design.github.com/dungeons-and-dragging

To run it locally, clone the repo and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The game is then available on localhost:8080.
